		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_NoseCone_title = CSS-75D Deployable Nose Shield
		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_NoseCone_description = Designed to fit with the CSS-200 command cabin, this nose cone provides an aerodynamic front end to reduce drag. Can be deployed to allow for docking port access, or jettisoned entirely.

		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_Pod_title = CSS-200 "Decondo" Crew Cabin
		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_Pod_description = With expansive windows, built-in RCS and an integrated set of abort motors, the CSS-200 makes for a very capable command pod in a wide variety of use cases. Unexpected passengers not included.

		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_tether0625_title = CSS-T06 Extendable Rigid Tether (0.625m)
		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_tether0625_description = Small but sturdy, this micro-sized extendable attachment system extends up to 50m.

		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_tether125_title = CSS-T12 Extendable Rigid Tether (1.25m)
		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_tether125_description = Through physics we don't yet truly understand, the CSS-T12 pays out a coiled cable that rigidizes on deployment, allowing a small form factor to extend into an extremely large rigid structure. Extends up to 100m.

		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_tether250_title = CSS-T25 Extendable Rigid Tether (2.5m)
		#LOC_Benjee10_stowaway_tether250_description = The largest of the Coriolis space tether range, the CSS-T25 provides an extremely sturdy extendable attachment system. With multiple redundant cables, the potential for unscheduled detachment was reduced down to only 47%! Extends up to 150m.
